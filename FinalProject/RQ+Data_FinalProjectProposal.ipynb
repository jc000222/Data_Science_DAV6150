    "# 2 Reasearch Questions\n",
    "1. __What are the key factors affecting hotel booking cancellation, and how can we predict the cancellations?__  \n",
    "    The research into factors influencing hotel booking cancellations and predictive modeling can have significant implement for the hotel bussiness. Most online travel agency have loose cancellation policy for users, in oreder to encourage the booking activities. However the pressure for handling the cancellations falls on the hotels, for cancelled rooms lead to revenue loss and reduced profits due to price reductions, and increase advertising costs. By identifying key factors in booking information that contribute to cancellations, such as lead time, deposit type, and special requests, hotels can predict the cancellation of the booking orders and  make informed decisions about overbooking, room pricing, and staffing levels, ultimately enhancing efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "    With this predictive model, hotels can proactively identify which users are likely to cancel their bookings and take remedial actions in a timely manner. For instance, by reaching out to users with a higher likelihood of cancellation in advance, hotels can encourage them to cancel their bookings as early as possible, thereby allowing the hotel to free up more rooms for sale.Alternatively, hotels can also engage with users who show tendencies to cancel by highlighting the advantages of staying at the hotel and offering incentives or rewards for staying, aiming to persuade them to retain their bookings.\n",
    "2. __Does different deposit types have different pattern when predicting the booking cancellations?__  \n",
    "    Exploring the impact of various deposit types on hotel booking cancellations can provide valuable insights into understanding customer behavior and optimizing cancellation prediction models. Different deposit types, such as non-refundable deposits, refundable deposits, or no deposits, may influence cancellation patterns differently due to varying levels of commitment from guests. Understanding how each deposit type can aid hotels in deciding their cancellation policies and pricing strategies to mitigate revenue loss and maximize profitability. For example, if a predictive model indicates that bookings made with non-refundable deposits have a higher likelihood of cancellation, hotels can reach out to these guests ahead of time to encourage them to confirm or modify their bookings. \n"

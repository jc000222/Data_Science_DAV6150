    "## 1 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to create a predictive model that can be used to accurately predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled. This is important for hotels because canceled bookings can severely impact a hotel's revenue and related operational strategies. Accurate information about room reservations is key to decrease the hotel losses, such as the profit loss of last-minute cancellations. Whether a hotel receives advance notice or not, these cancellations result in vacancies in their booked rooms that could have been re-rented to others. However when cancellations are received at the last minute, which can make it difficult to schedule re-released rooms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The negative impact of cancellations includes not only the loss of revenue from these vacant rooms, but also the additional costs associated with the distribution channel for re-booking, as well as lower profit margins due to having to sell the rooms at a reduced price at the last minute. However, by accurately predicting cancellations and taking steps that can effectively decrease the negative impact of cancellations, hotels can improve profitability and operational efficiency. We utilize a dataset containing a wide range of booking-related factors to provide valuable insights for hotel management. Our goal is to build a robust model that helps hotels refine their operational processes and maximize the revenue."

    "## 2 Reasearch Questions\n",
    "1. __What are the key factors affecting hotel booking cancellation, and how can we predict the cancellations?__  \n",
    "    The research into factors influencing hotel booking cancellations and predictive modeling can have significant implement for the hotel bussiness. Most online travel agency have loose cancellation policy for users, in oreder to encourage the booking activities. However the pressure for handling the cancellations falls on the hotels, for cancelled rooms lead to revenue loss and reduced profits due to price reductions, and increase advertising costs. By identifying key factors in booking information that contribute to cancellations, such as lead time, deposit type, and special requests, hotels can predict the cancellation of the booking orders and  make informed decisions about overbooking, room pricing, and staffing levels, ultimately enhancing efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "    With this predictive model, hotels can proactively identify which users are likely to cancel their bookings and take remedial actions in a timely manner. For instance, by reaching out to users with a higher likelihood of cancellation in advance, hotels can encourage them to cancel their bookings as early as possible, thereby allowing the hotel to free up more rooms for sale.Alternatively, hotels can also engage with users who show tendencies to cancel by highlighting the advantages of staying at the hotel and offering incentives or rewards for staying, aiming to persuade them to retain their bookings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. __Does different deposit types have different pattern when predicting the booking cancellations?__  \n",
    "    Exploring the impact of various deposit types on hotel booking cancellations can provide valuable insights into understanding customer behavior and optimizing cancellation prediction models. Different deposit types, such as non-refundable deposits, refundable deposits, or no deposits, may influence cancellation patterns differently due to varying levels of commitment from guests. Understanding how each deposit type can aid hotels in deciding their cancellation policies and pricing strategies to mitigate revenue loss and maximize profitability. For example, if a predictive model indicates that bookings made with non-refundable deposits have a higher likelihood of cancellation, hotels can reach out to these guests ahead of time to encourage them to confirm or modify their bookings. \n"

    "# 4 Approach\n",
    "To address the research questions regarding the key factors affecting hotel booking cancellations and the impact of deposit types on cancellation predictions, the following plan outlines the management, analysis, and modeling approaches for the dataset.\n",
    "#### Data Management\n",
    "Because the dataset is pretty huge. So it will be stored and managed in a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL for efficient querying, analysis, and storage. This approach allows for effective handling of the data's structure and relationships, facilitating easy retrieval and manipulation of records for analysis. \n",
    "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
    "To explore the dataset and identify potential factors influencing booking cancellations, initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. This will include summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.\n",
    "#### Project Report Structure\n",
    "__1. Abstract:__ Summarize our problem, methodology, and major outcomes.  \n",
    "__2. Introduction:__ Briefly describe the purpose and motivation behind the project, introduce the dataset, including its origin, size, and the types of variables it contains and clearly state the question or problem our project aims to address.  \n",
    "__3. Exploratory Data Analysis:__ Conduct an initial exploration to understand the dataset's characteristics, such as distributions of key variables, presence of missing values, and potential outliers.The following are diagrams that may be used.  \n",
    "- Correlation Heatmaps: To visualize the relationships between different variables and identify those most correlated with booking cancellations.\n",
    "- Bar Charts and histogram: To illustrate the distribution of categorical variables like hotel type, deposit type, and market segment.\n",
    "- Box Plots: To explore the distribution of numerical variables and identify outliers or anomalies that could affect cancellation predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Data Preparation:__ Clean and preprocess the data to enhance its quality and suitability for modeling, including addressing missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.  \n",
    "__5. Prepped Data Overview:__ Conduct a secondary EDA on the prepared data to verify its readiness for modeling and to refine the analysis strategy.  \n",
    "__6. Machine Learning Models:__ Build the models to identify the most effective approach for the research question. Thses are models we are going to use:  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a statistical method widely used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of an event occurring. In the context of hotel booking cancellations, it can be used to estimate the probability of a booking being canceled.The model is simple and highly interpretable, making it suitable as a baseline model.\n",
    "- Neural Network Model: Neural Networks mimic the structure and function of the human brain, suitable for dealing with complex nonlinear problems. With a multi-layered structure, neural networks can capture and learn deep features and patterns in the data. And the model is with powerful data fitting capabilities, particularly effective for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "- Decision Tree Model: Decision Trees split the data through a series of rules, each split representing a decision node, until the prediction objective is reached. It is an intuitive model that clearly shows the decision-making process and logic. The model is easy to understand and interpret, visually representing the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "__7. Model Selection:__ Evaluate model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.Compare the performance of different models to identify the most suitable one for predicting hotel booking cancellations.  \n",
    "__8. Ensemble Model:__  In addition to these individual models, an ensemble approach will be considered to combine the predictions from each model to improve overall accuracy. The ensemble method could be a simple voting ensemble, where predictions from each model are combined to make a final decision, or a more complex stacking approach, where the outputs of individual models serve as inputs to a final model that makes the ultimate prediction.  \n",
    "__9. Conclusions:__  Summarize the project's findings, the efficacy of the selected model, and suggest avenues for future research building on the current work."
